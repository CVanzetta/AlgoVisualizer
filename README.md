# AlgoVisualizer

A simple Spring Boot application that demonstrates sorting algorithms in the browser.

## Prerequisites

- **Java 21** or higher.
- No need to install Maven separately. The project includes the Maven Wrapper (`mvnw`).

## Build and Run

Use the Maven Wrapper to start the application:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

This downloads all dependencies on the first run and starts the server on port 8080 by default.

## Accessing the Visualizer

Once the application is running, open your web browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

You should see the sorting visualizer interface. Select an algorithm, click **Start Sorting**, and watch the visualization.
